How many ways are there to permute the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI?
#+END_QUOTE

There are 11 letters in mississippi. The expression $11!$ gets close
but overcounts by considering different instances of a letter in the
same position as different events. So we have to adjust for
overcounting 4 I's, 4 S's and 2 P's. So the result is

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{align*}
  \frac{11!}{(4!)(4!)(2!)} = 34650
\end{align*}
#+END_EXPORT

Here is a small python script to verify this result

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
from collections import Counter

word = 'MISSISSIPPI'
n = len(word)
letter_counts = Counter(word)

def dfs_count(k, letter_counts):
    if k == n:
        return 1

    num_ways = 0

    for letter in letter_counts:
        num_ways += dfs_count(k+1, letter_counts - Counter(letter))

    return num_ways

count = dfs_count(0, letter_counts)

print('There are {} ways to permute {}'.format(count, word))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: There are 34650 ways to permute MISSISSIPPI
